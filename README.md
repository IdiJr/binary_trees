# 0x1D C - Binary trees

This project contains tasks performed to understand the following concepts:

* What is a binary tree
* What is the difference between a binary tree and a Binary Search Tree
* What is the possible gain in terms of time complexity compared to linked lists
* What are the depth, the height, the size of a binary tree
* What are the different traversal methods to go through a binary tree
* What is a complete, a full, a perfect, a balanced binary tree

## Tasks

0. New node - Function that creates a binary tree node
1. Insert left - Function that inserts a node as the left-child of another node
2. Insert right - Function that inserts a node as the right-child of another node
3. Delete - Function that deletes an entire binary tree
4. Is leaf - Function that checks if a node is a leaf
5. Is root - Function that checks if a given node is a root
6. Pre-order traversal - Function that goes through a binary tree using pre-order traversal
7. In-order taversal - Function that goes through a binary tree using in-order traversal
8. Post-order traversal - Function that goes through a binary tree using post-order traversal
9. Height - Function that measures the height of a binary tree
10. Depth - Function that measures the depth of a node in a binary tree
11. Size - Function that measures the size of a binary tree
12. Leaves - Function that counts the leaves in a binary tree
13. Nodes - Function that counts the nodes with at least 1 child in a binary tree
14. Balance factor - Function that measures the balance factor of a binary tree
15. Is full - Function that checks if a binary tree is full
16. Is perfect - Function that checks if a binary tree is perfect
17. Sibling - Function that finds the sibling of a node
18. Uncle - Function that finds the uncle of a node
